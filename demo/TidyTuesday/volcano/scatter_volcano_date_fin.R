# Volcanic activity over the last 320 years

# A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, 
# volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.
# 
# Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that 
# float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where
# tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.
# 
# Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. 
# One such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where
# ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine
# blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Large eruptions can affect temperature
# as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere (or troposphere); 
# however, they also absorb heat radiated from the Earth, thereby warming the upper atmosphere (or stratosphere). 
# Historically, volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines.
