# The analysis  identify the top three writers with the highest imdb ratings for the TV show "The office". 
# And used the tidtytext R package to examine the frequently used two word terms and their relationships, and identify (in a wordcloud) 
# the unique word used by each writer that are not used by the other two.

#Data Source: The schrute R package for The Office transcripts and data.world for IMDB ratings.
